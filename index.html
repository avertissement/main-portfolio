        <p class="entity">My name is Elliott Day, and I reside in Draper, Utah. Currently, I am taking a leave of absence from the school I am attending (the University of Utah) for various reasons and spending this time coding and working my job at Lowe's.</p>

        <h2 class="entity">About Me</h2>
        <p class="entity">Ever since I was very young, coding was something I was interested in and seriously considered getting involved with. However, I did not have the resources or means to do so at the time. Now, many years later, I finally get to realize that dream. Besides coding, I have always been involved in music and have played the organ, piano, and even sung in multiple choirs. I continue to do those things even today. My major at the University of Utah is accountancy, although, as I said earlier, I am taking a temporary leave of absence from attending the school due to personal reasons. However, I plan to return and acquire my degree beginning in Fall 2021. In the future, I want to have an arsenal of skills (such as expertise in Javascript, CSS, HTML, Java, C++, React, and more) so that I can exceed a client's expectations.</p>

        <h3>My first website</h3>
        <p class="entity">This project was the first website I ever made which does indeed mark an important milestone in my developer journey. You will notice that this project is very elementary;nevertheless, I still pride myself on it knowing I will very soon be able to write much more complex programs and websites. We all have to start somewhere! With all this being said, you will hopefully still recognize the complex characteristics of the website that I inserted to maximize my full potential. Some of these include email links, telephone links, pseudo-elements, absolute and relative links, and much more.</p>
